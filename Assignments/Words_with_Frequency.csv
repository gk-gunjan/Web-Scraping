ghee thatte idli😍😍,1
"popular in bangalore & mysore region, thatte idli is much bigger in size & softer as well compared to traditional idli. i had this one at idc kitchen in koramangala, bangalore. this idli was melt-in-mouth soft and it was served with a lot of ghee on top of it which made it even more delicious. super delicious taste in just 40 rs. recommended.👍🏻",1
